# SECAI LLM Training

This is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks about basic and advanced LLM usage, focusing on what's possible with the [ScaDS.AI Large Language Models (LLM) Services](https://llm.scads.ai) (VPN required). It aims at Python programmers in [SECAI](https://secai.org/) who want to dive into LLMs for generating text, code and data using open source/weights models.

Contributions and feedback are very welcome! In case you see room for improvement, please [create a github issue](https://github.com/ScaDS/secai_llm_training/issues) and/or consider [contributing](https://github.com/ScaDS/secai_llm_training/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Topics

The notebook collection aims covering these topics:
* Large Language Models (LLMs)
* Text/Code/Data generation
* Prompt Engineering
* Retrieval-augmented-generation
* Function calling
* Agents

## Covered Python libraries and software

In these notebooks we use non-standard libraries from the GenAI field. Installation instructions can be found either in the first chapter or in the readme of the respective subchapter.
